##Data sources
**Police stop & search**<br>
Data.police.uk (https://data.police.uk) makes lots of stop & search data available. It offers an API - but, on exploration, it seems like the API only gives access to s&s data back as far as 2021. 

The site also has an 'archive' page (https://data.police.uk/data/archive/), where a number of zipped folders are available for download. Each folder contains a number of subfolders containing one month's worth of data. For every month, there is one csv for each police force, for each data series (crime, outcome, stop & search data) - i.e. there are lots of files inside folders inside folders. The archive hosts data from Dec 2010 onwards - the stop & search data in particular goes back to about 2015 (depends on police force).
