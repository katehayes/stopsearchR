**Getting the data**
<br><br>
Data.police.uk (https://data.police.uk) makes lots of stop & search data available. 
On exploration, it seems like their API only allows access to s&s data back as far as 2021. However, in their archive (https://data.police.uk/data/archive/) they have a number of zipped folders available for download. Each folder contains a number of subfolders containing one months work of data. For every month, there is one csv for each police force for each data series (crime, outcome, stop & search data) - i.e. there are lots of files inside folders inside folders. The archive hosts data from Dec 2010 onwards - the stop & search data in particular goes back to about 2015 (depends on police force).
